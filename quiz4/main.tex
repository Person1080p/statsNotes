\item The acceptability of a capillary tube for a freezer application is found by measuring the pressure drop in pounds per square inch between the two ends of the tube. The pressures obtained from a manufacturing process of capillary tubes is found to be normally distributed with an average pressure of 130 pounds per square inch and a standard deviation of 4 pounds per square inch. Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What percent of the pressures are below 121 pounds per square inch?
    \item What percent of the pressure readings lie between 121 and 134 pounds per square inch ?
\end{enumerate}
